  <h2>Air Quality and Obesity in the U.S.: A Decade of Diverging Trends</h2>
  <p>Over the past decade, two major public health concerns—air pollution and obesity—have shown persistent and troubling trends across the United States. While environmental regulations have led to measurable improvements in air quality, obesity rates have continued to rise, particularly in the South and Midwest. This report explores the geographic and temporal patterns of these two issues, focusing on New York as a case study, and investigates whether there is a meaningful relationship between air pollution (PM2.5 levels) and physical activity or obesity rates.</p>
  <p>Through visualizations and data analysis, we examine whether cleaner air correlates with healthier behaviors and outcomes, and identify regions where both pollution and obesity are prevalent. Our findings suggest that while air quality improvements are real, they do not automatically translate into reduced obesity or increased physical activity—highlighting the need for integrated public health strategies.</p>
  <h3>Data Description</h3>
  <p><strong>Sources:</strong> EPA Air Quality System, CDC BRFSS, NYC Open Data, U.S. Census Bureau</p>
  <p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Year (2011–2023), PM2.5 Concentration, Obesity Rate, Physical Activity Rate, State/Borough/Region</p>
  <h3>Research Questions & Findings</h3>
  <h4>1. Geographic Patterns of Obesity and Activity</h4>
  <p>Southern and Midwestern states consistently show the highest obesity rates, above 35% by 2022. Meanwhile, Western and Northeastern states demonstrate healthier trends, both in obesity prevalence and physical activity rates. These disparities reflect systemic differences such as walkability, income, and public health investment.</p>
  <h4>2. Air Quality Trends Over Time</h4>
  <p>National PM2.5 levels declined between 2011 and 2016, largely driven by stronger emissions policy. Progress plateaued afterward, with localized increases tied to wildfires and traffic congestion. New York saw improvements from ~9 µg/m³ to ~7 µg/m³ during that period.</p>
  <h4>3. Correlation Between Air Quality and Physical Activity</h4>
  <p>In areas such as Flushing and Whitestone (CD7), a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) was observed between PM2.5 and physical activity—suggesting behavioral sensitivity to pollution levels.</p>
  <h4>4. Temporal Overlaps in Air Quality and Obesity Change</h4>
  <p>Air quality improvements did not produce proportional changes in obesity. Spikes in pollution reduce outdoor activity but do not immediately shift long-term obesity metrics.</p>
  <h4>5. Spatial Clustering of Dual-Burden Regions</h4>
  <p>States like Louisiana and Mississippi face both high pollution and high obesity. These regions may benefit most from targeted, dual-focused interventions that address behavioral and environmental risks.</p>
  <h4>6. Side-by-Side Trends of Air Quality and Health</h4>
  <p>Even as PM2.5 levels improve nationally, obesity continues its upward trajectory, emphasizing that environmental progress alone cannot combat behavioral health issues.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Air quality has improved, but obesity trends show little response. Pollution affects activity behavior more directly than long-term weight status. Policy efforts should integrate environmental regulation with health-oriented urban planning, greater walkability, and tailored support for high-risk regions.</p>
